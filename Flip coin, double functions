"""
Program uses 3 functions.

flip_coins takes in two arguments
which will be the name of the 3 variables "arg1" and "arg2" + "runs". The
arguments will have 50% of receiving 1 value and how many times the coin
will flip is determined by the user via "runs".

print_coin_result will take the returned item "a_list" from first function
and display the amount of both arg1 and arg2.

main function will use both other functions
